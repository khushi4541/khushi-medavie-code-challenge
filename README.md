# Medavie coding challenge

I would like to present my completed coding assignment **Forked**.
It is a website that displays various recipes and their related details that have been fetched from the spoonacular API.
I have used React + vite, JavaScript and SCSS to build out this application.
All of the required features have been included and in addition to that, I have also made the application responsive to phone, tablet and mobile!
I also changed the pagination to 6 recipes per page as I felt that this looked much better visually than 5 recipes per page.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity and I had a lot of fun working on this challenge!
